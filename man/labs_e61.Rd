\usage{
labs_e61(
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  footnotes = NULL,
  sources = NULL,
  title_max_char = NULL,
  subtitle_max_char = NULL,
  footnote_max_char = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{subtitle}{The text for the subtitle.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

\item{title_max_char, subtitle_max_char, footnote_max_char}{Numeric. Set the
maximum number of characters per line in the title, subtitle, sources or
footnotes. The default is roughly appropriate for the default graph
dimensions in \code{\link[theme61]{e61_save}}.}

\item{x, y}{String to set the x- and y-axis titles. Note that the x-axis title
is blank (NULL) by default.}

\item{...}{Additional graph component titles (optional).}

\item{title_wrap, subtitle_wrap, footnote_wrap}{Logical. Enables text wrapping
for the title, subtitle, sources or footnotes. Defaults to TRUE.}

\description{
Provides support for well-formatted titles and footer text with minimal user
adjustment needed.
}
\details{
You should use vectors in the footnotes and sources to take advantage of the
formatting features of this function.

The arguments in the function allow you to make changes to the text
formatting if required.

The primary purpose of this function is to correctly format footer
  text without requiring the user to guess where to put manual line breaks
  for long footnotes or put in "Sources:" themselves. It does this by
  transforming the \code{footnotes} and \code{sources} arguments into nicely
  formatted text that goes into the \code{caption} argument in ggplot2's
  \code{labs()} function. Thus, if you are using \code{footnotes} or
  \code{sources}, do not supply a \code{caption} argument as well.
