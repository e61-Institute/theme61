\usage{
theme_e61(
  legend = c("none", "bottom", "top", "left", "right", "inside"),
  legend_position = NULL,
  legend_title = FALSE,
  aspect_ratio = 0.75,
  background = "white",

  base_line_size = points_to_mm(0.75),

)

}
\arguments{
\item{legend}{Character. Legend position, "none" (default) hides the legend.}

\item{legend_position}{A numeric vector of length two setting the placement
of legends that have the "inside" position. Takes values between 0 and 1.}

\item{legend_title}{Logical. Include legend title? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{aspect_ratio}{Numeric. Sets the aspect ratio of the graph panel.}

\item{background}{Character. Default is "white". For all graphs that you
save, you should control the background colour using the \code{bg_colour}
argument in \code{save_e61}, not here.}

\item{base_family}{Character. Chart font family. Default for notes is PT
Sans.}

\item{base_line_size}{Numeric. Default line width.}

\item{base_rect_size}{Numeric. Default rect width.}

\item{base_size}{Numeric. Graph font size. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
\code{theme_e61} returns a ggplot2 object.

\code{set_base_size} is used for its side effects.
}
\description{
Applies the e61 theme to ggplot graphs and provides arguments to adjust graph
appearance. If you are looking to change the appearance of titles or labels,
check the arguments in \link{labs_e61}, which are probably what you are looking
for.

\code{set_base_size} sets the base size for the theme to be used in
\code{theme_e61()}. This needs to be set outside of the function because it
is called by other functions as part of the graph rendering process.
