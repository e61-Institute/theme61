\usage{
theme_e61(
  y_top = TRUE,
  fix_left = 0,
  adj = 0,
  legend = c("none", "bottom", "top", "left", "right"),
  legend_title = FALSE,
  aspect_ratio = 0.75,
  panel_borders = TRUE,
  background = "white",
  base_size = 10,

  base_rect_size = points_to_mm(1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_top}{Defaults to TRUE. Puts the y-axis title at the top. If you
change this argument you also need to change the argument with the same
name in \code{\link[theme61]{scale_y_continuous_e61}}.}

\item{fix_left}{Optional. Sometimes if the value of the \code{adj} argument
is too negative, the margins on the left side of the graph start to cut off
some of the text. Provide a small positive value (5?) to correct this.}

\item{adj}{Either a single numeric to adjust left and right axis titles
simultaneously or a vector of 2 numerics to adjust each axis title
separately. More negative values move the text closer to the graph panel.
Defaults to -12 which seems to work well for y-axis with 1-3 character-wide
values.}

\item{legend}{Character. Legend position, "none" (default) hides the legend.}

\item{legend_title}{Logical. Include Legend title? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{aspect_ratio}{Numeric. Sets the aspect ratio of the graph panel.}

\item{panel_borders}{Logical. Show panel borders? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{background}{Character. Default is "white". For all graphs that you
save, you should control the background colour using the \code{bg_colour}
argument in \code{save_e61}, not here.}

\item{base_size}{Numeric. Chart font size. Default is 10.}

\item{base_family}{Character. Chart font family. Default for notes is PT
Sans.}

\item{base_line_size}{Numeric. Default line width.}

\item{base_rect_size}{Numeric. Default rect width.}

\description{
Applies the e61 theme to ggplot graphs and provides arguments to adjust graph
appearance. If you are looking to change the appearance of titles or labels,
check the arguments in \code{\link[theme61]{labs_e61}}, which are probably
what you are looking for.
