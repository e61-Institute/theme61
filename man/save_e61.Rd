\arguments{
\item{filename}{File name to create on disk. Providing the file format
extension (e.g. .svg) is suggested when saving to a single file format. The
file extension must be lowercase. If you want to save to multiple formats,
do not include the extension, see the \code{format} argument for details.}

\item{...}{(multi-panel specific) Plot objects to put on the panel.}

\item{plot}{(single-panel specific) Name of the plot object to save. Defaults
to the last plot displayed so usually you do not need to provide this
argument explicitly.}

\item{format}{A string vector of file formats to save as. Accepts "svg",
"pdf", "eps", "png", "jpg". For example \code{c("svg", "pdf")} will save 2 files
with the same name to the same location to SVG and PDF formats. If the file
format is specified in \code{filename} or by the \code{set_format} option, then this
argument is ignored.}

\item{chart_type}{String, or vector of strings if saving multiple plots. Type
of chart. This is used to set sensible chart widths based on the type of
plot you are saving. Options are "normal" (default; for normal charts),
"wide" (for time series graphs) or "square" (for scatter plots).}

\item{auto_scale}{Logical. Scale the y-axis automatically. Default is TRUE.}

\item{dim}{An optional named list specifying the plot height and width.
Defaults to NULL which means the graph dimensions will be calculated
automatically.}

\item{pad_width}{Numeric. Add horizontal whitespace to the sides of the
graph. Defaults to no additional padding.}

\item{max_height}{Numeric. The maximum height of your plot in cm. This is
used to constrain the plot resizing algorithm in cases where you want to
limit the height of your charts. Defaults to NULL which does not restrict
the height.}

\item{preview}{Logical. Set to TRUE to show a preview of the graph in the
Viewer pane but not save to disk. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{save_data}{Logical. Set to TRUE if you want to save a .csv with the
same name as the graph that contains the data needed to recreate the graph
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{print_info}{Logical. Set to TRUE if you want graph dimensions and other
information printed to the console. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{spell_check}{Logical. Check spelling of words in the title and caption.
Defaults to TRUE. Set to FALSE to turn off.}

\item{base_size}{Numeric. Chart font size. Default is 10.}

\item{res}{Numeric. For saving to PNG only. Rescale the size of the saved
PNG. E.g. \code{res = 2} doubles the size of the saved graph.}

\item{bg_colour}{Set the graph background colour. Accepts a colour name, hex
code or theme61 colour object name. Defaults to "white". For graphs used in
research note boxes, set the colour to \code{e61_boxback}.}

\item{plotlist}{(multi-panel specific) List of plots to combine as an
multi-panel and save. You can also enter the charts individually as
arguments to the function.}

\item{title}{The text for the title.}

\item{subtitle}{The text for the subtitle.}

\item{footnotes}{A vector of footnote text strings. Each new string will be
prepended with *, **, ***, etc. Note you'll need to include the asterisks
in the title/subtitle yourself. Please be sensible with the number of
separate points you include in the graph.}

\item{sources}{String vector providing the names of sources for the graph.}

\item{spacing_adj}{(multi-panel specific) A named list specifying the
adjustment to the title and subtitle. Rescales the size of the space given
to the multi-panel title/subtitle. Use if you think the title looks too
cramped on the chart.}

\item{height_adj}{(multi-panel specific) Rescales the height of the
multi-panel. The function sets sensible defaults but this provides you with
manual control if you need it.}

\item{ncol}{(optional) Number of columns in the plot grid.}

\item{nrow}{(optional) Number of rows in the plot grid.}

\item{align}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally ("h") or
vertically ("v") aligned. Options are "none" (default), "hv" (align in both directions), "h", and "v".}

\item{axis}{(optional) Specifies whether graphs should be aligned by the left ("l"), right ("r"), top ("t"), or bottom ("b")
margins. Options are "none" (default), or a string of any combination of l, r, t, and b in any order (e.g. "tblr" or "rlbt" for aligning all margins).
Must be specified if any of the graphs are complex (e.g. faceted) and alignment is specified and desired. See \code{\link[cowplot:align_plots]{align_plots()}} for details.}

\item{rel_heights}{(multi-panel specific) A numeric vector giving the
relative proportions of each graph component (title, plots, footer).}

\value{
Invisibly returns the file name.

\description{
Saves ggplot2 graphs made with using theme61. Using \code{save_e61()} is required
to ensure graphs are consistent with the e61 style and formatting.
}
\details{
Use PDF in all notes and SVG in PowerPoint presentations. PDFs and SVGs are
better as they are modern vector graphics file formats which can be scaled up
and down in size without blurring or becoming pixelated. PNG should only be
used when required for compatibility reasons.
