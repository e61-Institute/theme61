\description{
Horizontal bar graphs made with \code{coord_flip()} require some changes to
the \code{theme()} in order to look proper. This function wraps those changes
up in a convenient function that should be appended at the end of the graph
code, after theming functions such as \code{theme_e61()} have been called.
