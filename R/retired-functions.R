# This file contains the names of defunct functions following past breaking
# changes. Remove these entirely after 2 minor release versions have passed.
# i.e. if a function was made defunct in v0.2, then remove the function error
# message code entirely from v0.4 onwards, as users have had ample warning to
# fix their code.

# Remove entirely from v0.8 -------------------------------------------------------
